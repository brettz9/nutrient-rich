## Ideas

3D world to go shopping and show foods and their amounts that can make
a deficiency.

Like to get (or lose) so many grams of Vitamin C, you can take 10 oranges,
5 lemons, 20 watermeons, and the opposite if drinking 2 Coca Colas,
smoking 5 cigarrettes, etc.

I am thinking the user could choose to pile them so they look to scale
(easier to judge for shopping) or an option to just show the numbers.
