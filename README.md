## To-dos

1. General fixes to input box setting
    1. Reason for **non-matching names**?
    1. Need for **unit comparison**?
    1. Display **table unit in more readable format**
1. **Pagination** to see (or grab?) more foods
1. Option to **filter** inputs by non-zero ones and **sort** at least by
    potency, i.e., needing a lower amount, though might also prefer
    non-decimal ones or closer to "1"

## Medium-priority to-dos

1. Might use custom elements features of hyperHTMLElement for readability
1. Use `rank` if useful (a matter of proportional power?)

## Ideas for longer term

3D world to go shopping and show foods and their amounts that can make
a deficiency.

Like to get (or lose) so many grams of Vitamin C, you can take 10 oranges,
5 lemons, 20 watermeons, and the opposite if drinking 2 Coca Colas,
smoking 5 cigarrettes, etc.

I am thinking the user could choose to pile them so they look to scale
(easier to judge for shopping) or an option to just show the numbers.
